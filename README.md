Android Basics Nanodegree - Project 9 Inventory App

This project introduces students to using SQLite databases within Android apps. This app, once complete, will be able to function as an editable inventory list for a store setting.

What I will utilize is this project will be the following:

SQLite databases
Create, Read, Update, and Delete abilities for database items
Floating button for adding items
